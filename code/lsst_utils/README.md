# `lsst_utils`

These are files that are copied from the lsst project simulations code found
in the packages [sims_photUtils](https://github.com/lsst/sims_photUtils). Since
there is currently no easy way to install just the sims_photUtils package I
copied them here as a way to keep everything together and easy to use.
